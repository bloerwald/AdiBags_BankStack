*AdiBags_BankStack* adds the [BankStack](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-bankstack) addon's button to [AdiBags](https://github.com/AdiAddons/AdiBags) mini buttons on top of bags.

The only crazy thing it does additionally is being context aware and only offer options that make sense when not at the bank:

- When at bank:
  - button in bank frame defaults to stacking to bank
  - button in bags frame defaults to stacking to bags
- Otherwise:
  - button defaults to compressing bag stacks
